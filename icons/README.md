# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files for the Tab Cleanser extension:

## Required Icon Sizes

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon32.png` - 32x32 pixels  
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

## Icon Specifications

- Format: PNG
- Background: Transparent or solid color
- Style: Should represent a cookie or cleaning concept
- Colors: Should match the extension's purple gradient theme (#667eea to #764ba2)

## Creating Icons

You can create these icons using:
- Online icon generators
- Graphic design software (Photoshop, GIMP, Figma)
- Icon libraries (Material Icons, FontAwesome)

## Example Icon Concept

A simple cleaning brush or broom icon would be perfect for this extension.

## Temporary Solution

Until you create custom icons, you can:
1. Use placeholder images
2. Download free cookie/cleaning icons from icon libraries
3. Create simple colored squares as temporary placeholders

The extension will work without icons, but they improve the user experience and make the extension look more professional.
